# Get Step Series

**Group:** App

**Description:** Retrieves ordered sequences (step series) of tasks that form a ladder of challenges. This endpoint is ideal for progressive sequences where each task must be completed in order.

**Route:** /v2/client/app/get-step-series

**Method:** POST

## Parameters

- **taskGroupIds**: An array of task group IDs that identify the step series.
- **includeInactiveTasks**: If true, the response includes tasks that are not currently active in the series.
- **limit**: Maximum number of step series tasks to return.
- **offset**: Number of tasks to skip for pagination in the series.
- **includeTags**: An array of tags to further filter or categorize the step series.
- **scheduleStatuses**: An array of schedule statuses to filter the step series tasks.

## Attributes

- **tasks.rewardDetails** (object): An object containing reward information for completion of each task within the step series group (e.g., bonus XP, virtual currency, items awarded upon completion of any task). Will only take effect if 'tasks' is included in requested attributes.
- **tasks** (array): Additional Details about the tasks in the step series
- **unlockConditions** (array): An array of conditions required to unlock the step series
- **schedule** (object): An object specifying the timing details for the step series (e.g., start time, end time, recurrence pattern).
- **meta** (object): Additional metadata about the step series
- **tags** (array): An array of tags used to categorize and search for the step series
- **tasks.linkedRewardDetails** (object): An object containing reward details that link individual task completion within the group to another player (e.g., referral rewards) so that both players receive a bonus. Will only take effect if 'tasks' is included in requested attributes.

## Examples

### Retrieve All Step Series with Default Information

In this example, we retrieve all step series with minimal default information. This is suitable when you need basic information about available progression paths in your game.
Context for Arcadia Nexus:
For Arcadia Nexus, this would return a list of all available step series progression paths, such as the "Cyber District Initiation" sequence that introduces players to the digital realm, or the "Fire Walker's Path" that guides players through mastering the challenges of the Fire Realm. This basic information allows players to browse through available progressions before deciding which journey to embark on.

### Retrieve Active Step Series with Task Details and Rewards

In this example, we retrieve only step series that are currently active, including their constituent tasks and rewards. This is useful for displaying current progression paths and their potential rewards to players.
Context for Arcadia Nexus:
For Arcadia Nexus, this would return active progression sequences like the "Forest Whispers Journey," showing each sequential task such as "Discover the Ancient Grove," "Communicate with Forest Spirits," and "Retrieve the Whisperwood Artifact," along with the rewards players will earn at each step. This detailed view helps players understand the path ahead and the valuable items, currencies, or abilities they can gain by completing each task in sequence, encouraging them to progress through the narrative journey of the Forest of Whispers realm.

### Retrieve a Specific Step Series with Complete Details

In this example, we retrieve a specific step series by its ID with all available attributes to get complete information about this progression path.
Context for Arcadia Nexus:
For Arcadia Nexus, this would fetch the complete details for the "Cyber District Initiation" sequence, revealing the full journey a player must take to become integrated into the digital realm. The response would include the sequence of tasks from "Creating a Digital Identity" to "Accessing the Central Data Core," along with unlock requirements (like having reached level 5 in general progression), schedule information showing when this initiation path is available, metadata like difficulty and narrative significance, tags categorizing it as a "beginner" and "story" sequence, and detailed reward information for each step. This comprehensive information allows players to fully understand what's required to begin their journey in the Cyber District, what rewards they'll earn at each step, and how this progression path fits into the broader Arcadia Nexus experience.

Meta Object (if requested):
The meta object contains additional, step series-specific metadata that is entirely user-defined through the Specter dashboard. This allows you to attach any custom data needed for your specific implementation without any predefined structure.
Tags Array (if requested):
An array of strings representing tags associated with the step series. These tags are completely user-defined in the Specter dashboard and can be used for filtering and categorization as needed for your application.
Notes

Default Response: If no attributes array is provided, the response will include only the minimal default attributes for each step series.

Filtering by Tags: Use the includeTags parameter to retrieve step series that have any of the specified tags.

Pagination: Use limit and offset parameters to paginate through the list of step series.

Schedule Status Filtering: Filter step series by their current schedule status to show only relevant series to players.

Inactive Tasks: By default, inactive tasks are excluded from the response. Set includeInactiveTasks to true to include them.

Task Details: Request the tasks attribute to get detailed information about the individual tasks within each step series.

Ordered Progression: Unlike regular task groups, step series are designed for sequential progression, where tasks must be completed in the order they are presented.

Data Usage: Be mindful of the amount of data requested, especially for clients with limited bandwidth. Only request necessary attributes to optimize performance.

Â 
Integration Tips

Visual Progression: Implement a visual path or journey map in your UI to show players their progress through step series, highlighting completed tasks and upcoming challenges.

Reward Previews: Display the cumulative rewards for completing the entire step series to motivate players to progress through all tasks.

Narrative Flow: Use step series to create compelling storylines where each task builds upon the previous one to tell a cohesive narrative about a realm or character.
