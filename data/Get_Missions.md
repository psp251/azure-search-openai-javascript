## Examples

### Retrieve All Missions with Default Information

In this example, we retrieve all missions with minimal default information. This is suitable when you need basic mission information for displaying a missions board or journal in your game.
Context for Arcadia Nexus:
For Arcadia Nexus, this would return all missions across the different realms, providing an overview of the various storylines and challenge series available to players. This data could be used to populate the main Missions Journal interface, showing activities like the "Fire Realm Initiation" series or the "Cyber District Security" mission line without loading detailed task information. Players can browse these mission groups to decide which storylines they want to pursue across the metaverse.

### Retrieve Active Missions with Tasks and Rewards

In this example, we retrieve only missions that are currently active, including their tasks and reward details. This is useful for showing players their current mission progress and available rewards.
Context for Arcadia Nexus:
For Arcadia Nexus, this would return all currently active mission series with their component tasks and rewards. For example, during the "Cyber Festival" event, players could see the "Digital Liberation" mission series with its individual hacking tasks, each offering specific Cyber Credits or digital artifacts as rewards. The mission completion reward might include a unique "Neural Interface" item that can only be earned by completing the entire series. This comprehensive view helps players prioritize which mission lines to focus on and understand the full progression of rewards they'll earn along the way.

### Retrieve Specific Missions by IDs with Complete Details

In this example, we retrieve specific missions by their IDs, requesting all available attributes to get complete information about these mission series.
Context for Arcadia Nexus:
For Arcadia Nexus, this would fetch complete details for two specific mission series: the "Forest Guardian Series," which involves protecting the Forest of Whispers from corruption, and the "Nexus Explorer Path," which guides players through discovering hidden areas across all realms. When a player selects these particular mission lines in their journal, the game can display everything: all component tasks like "Cleanse the Ancient Grove" or "Discover the Hidden Nexus Portal"; the rewards for each step such as Forest Essence or special navigation tools; unlock requirements like having reached level 15 in the Forest Realm Progression; timing information showing how long these missions will remain available; and additional metadata like difficulty ratings and suggested group sizes. This comprehensive information helps players plan their gameplay sessions and understand how these mission series fit into the broader Arcadia Nexus experience.

### Filter Missions by Tags

In this example, we retrieve missions based on specific tags to find mission series of a particular category or theme.
Context for Arcadia Nexus:
For Arcadia Nexus, this would retrieve mission series tagged as "seasonal" (limited-time event missions) or "solo_friendly" (designed for individual play without requiring a group). This filtering allows players to find appropriate content for their current situation - perhaps they're looking for solo content they can complete during the current "Summer Solstice" seasonal event. By including the schedule attribute, players can see exactly how long they have to complete these special mission series, helping them prioritize time-limited content before it expires. This targeted filtering makes it easier for players to navigate the vast content offerings of Arcadia Nexus and find experiences that match their current playstyle and availability.

Pagination: Use limit and offset parameters to paginate through the list of missions.

Schedule Status Filtering: Filter missions by their current schedule status to show only relevant missions to players.

Inactive Tasks: By default, inactive tasks are excluded from the response. Set includeInactiveTasks to true to include them.

Task Details: Request the tasks attribute to get detailed information about the individual tasks within each mission.

Data Usage: Be mindful of the amount of data requested, especially for clients with limited bandwidth. Only request necessary attributes to optimize performance.

Integration Tips

Mission Progression: Use visual indicators to show players their progress through mission series, highlighting completed tasks and next objectives.

Reward Previews: Display the cumulative rewards for completing entire mission series to motivate players to finish all component tasks.

Time-Limited Indicators: Use schedule information to create urgency around seasonal or limited-time mission series with countdown timers or special visual effects.

Cross-Realm Navigation: If a mission series spans multiple realms of Arcadia Nexus, provide travel guidance or shortcuts to help players efficiently navigate between mission locations.

Difficulty Scaling: Use the meta information to clearly communicate mission difficulty and recommended player levels, helping players choose appropriate content for their character progression.

Storytelling Elements: Organize missions into narrative arcs that reveal more of the Arcadia Nexus lore as players progress through connected series.

The Get Missions endpoint provides the foundation for creating engaging multi-step challenges, storylines, and guided progression in your game. By effectively utilizing this structured approach to grouped tasks, you can create coherent gameplay experiences that guide players through the diverse realms of Arcadia Nexus while providing regular rewards and a sense of accomplishment.
